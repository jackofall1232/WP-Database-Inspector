# WordPress Database Inspector

**WordPress Database Inspector** is a lightweight, admin-only utility plugin that helps you inspect database and cache usage in WordPress and safely clean up clutter when needed.

This plugin focuses on **visibility first** — showing you where bloat exists before offering optional, manual cleanup actions.

## Features

- Database health gauge with clear visual feedback
- View total database size (when supported by hosting)
- Inspect autoloaded options that load on every page
- Identify expired and unused transients
- Detect post revisions, auto-drafts, spam, and trash
- Find orphaned post meta and comment meta
- Flush external object cache (when enabled)
- Optional **read-only mode** for audit-only environments
- Multisite-aware
- Shared-host safe
- **Admin-only** (no frontend impact)

All cleanup actions are manual, protected by WordPress nonces, and require explicit confirmation.

## Why This Plugin Exists

Many “optimizer” plugins aggressively delete data without showing what’s happening first.  
WordPress Database Inspector takes a safer approach:

> **Inspect → Understand → Decide → Clean**

You stay in control.
